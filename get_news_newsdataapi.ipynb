While we\\'ve seen some of our favorite gadgets go on sale since the start of November, today\\'s the day you\\'re almost guaranteed to find the best prices of the year across laptops, TVs, speakers, tablets, wearables and much more. For example, one of the stand-out Apple Black Friday deals is on the latest AirPods Pro, which are on sale for $200 for Black Friday. But, as usual, the sheer volume of Black Friday deals on tech across the web today makes it even harder to pick out the gems among them. There are absolutely tech \"deals\" out there today that are not worth your time. To make ease the burden of deal-hunting, we collected the best Black Friday tech deals we could find right here.Apple AirPods Pro (2nd gen)The latest AirPods Pro are on sale for $200 for Black Friday. That $50 discount is the most significant we\\'ve seen on these buds that just came out a couple of months ago. The new Pros earned a score of 88 from us for their improved sound quality, excellent Transparency Mode and solid active noise cancellation. We also appreciate the addition of the U1 chip inside the buds\\' wireless charging case, which enables Precision Finding using the Find My app.Apple AirTags (4 pack)A four-pack of Apple\\'s AirTags is on sale for $80 right now, which is $20 off their usual price. That also brings the price per tracker down to $20, which is one of the lowest we\\'ve seen. These stocking-friendly gadgets make great gifts for iPhone users who want to digitally keep track of their things. They can use the Find My app to check the last known location of their keys, wallet and other belongings, and use their iPhones to be led directly to their stuff with on-screen directions if it\\'s nearby.Apple 10.2-inch iPadThe 2021 iPad remains on sale for $270, which is the best price we\\'ve seen it. While Apple did just come out with an updated version, that latest model is much more expensive, coming in at $449. The 10.2-inch iPad is still a great option if you want iPadOS but only have so much to spend. We gave it a score of 86 for its solid performance, improved front cameras and excellent battery life.MacBook Air M1Apple\\'s M1-powered MacBook Air is down to $799 for Black Friday, which is the best price we\\'ve seen. Although the M2 laptop is available now, the M1 machine remains a good option if you\\'re upgrading from an aging Intel model. We gave it a score of 94 for its blazing fast performance, lovely Retina display and lack of fan noise.Apple Watch SE (2nd gen)The second-generation Apple Watch SE is on sale for $229, which is an all-time-low price. Apple upgrade a lot in this smartwatch — it has a new SiP and a larger screen, both of which help the new SE look and feel more modern. Apple still left some features to the Series 8, include an always-on display, ECG reader, skin temperature sensor and a few others, but if you can live without those upgrades, the Apple Watch SE gives you a ton of value at its relatively affordable price.Apple Pencil (2nd gen)The second-generation Apple Pencil is back down to a record-low price of $89 for Black Friday. There are still a couple of iPads that only work with the first-gen stylus, but most of the higher-end models support this one. We consider it to be the best stylus for the iPad, and we like it for its low latency and built-in magnets that let it attach to the side of your tablet.Chromecast with Google TVBoth the 4K and HD Chromecasts with Google TV are on sale for Black Friday, coming in at $40 and $18, respectively. These two streamers are essentially the same, expect for the resolution that each support: the higher-end model with stream 4K content, while the other tops out at 1080p. They share a compact design and both come with a handy remote that makes navigating the Google TV interface much easier. Plus, you can speak to the Google Assistant through these dongles, calling about it to search for things to watch, answer questions and more.Anker NanoAnker\\'s Black Friday deals have discounted a bunch of charging devices, including the Nano 3 30W charger, which you can pick up for only $16. The Nano 3 combines versatility with affordability thanks to the fact that it can fully power-up things like your phone, tablet and even a MacBook Air without breaking a sweat. Only the white model is on sale, and its discounted price expires at the end of Black Friday.Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBTThe excellent and already affordable ATH-M20xBT are on sale for $59 for Black Friday, which is a record low. These are our current favorite budget cans thanks to their good sound quality, comfortable design, Bluetooth multi-point connectivity and 60-hour battery life. They may not have as slick of a design as more expensive headphones, or advanced features like noise cancellation, but you can\\'t beat their value.Bose QuietComfort 45The Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones are back on sale for $249 right now, or 32 percent off their usual price. These are some of our favorite over-ear cans thanks in part to their excellent active noise cancellation and clear, balanced audio. The design isn\\'t as slick as some of our other favorites, but they\\'re comfortable to boot, plus their 24-hour battery life means you\\'ll be able to wear them for long stretches of time without interruption.Sony WH-1000XM5Sony\\'s WH-1000XM5 headphones are down to $348 right now, which is the best price we\\'ve seen since they came out earlier this year. These are our current favorite wireless headphones, and Sony essentially changed only a few things about the previous WH-1000XM4 to make these cans even better. They have improved noise cancellation and sound quality, plus a slick new design and a solid battery life. We also appreciate their Speak-to-Chat feature and multi-device connectivity.Google Pixel Buds ProGoogle\\'s best earbuds yet, the Pixel Buds Pro, have dropped to $150, which is $50 less than their usual price. these are the Android-maker\\'s answers to Apple\\'s AirPods Pro, and they are, without a doubt, one of the best pairs of wireless earbuds you can get if you don\\'t have an iPhone. We gave them a score of 87 for their deep, punchy bass, reliable touch controls and wireless charging case.Elgato Stream Deck MK.2Elgato\\'s Stream Deck MK.2 has dropped to $120 for Black Friday, which is a new record low. We\\'ve recommended various versions of the Stream Deck for a while now as an essential accessory for game streamers, but also a handy peripheral for power users to have, too. The MK.2 has 15 programmable buttons that let you trigger actions like launching an app, muting your mic and more, plus you can truly make it your own with a custom faceplate.65-inch LG A2 OLED smart TVBoth 2021 and 2022 LG TVs have been discounted for Black Friday. If you have your heart set on an OLED, the 65-inch A2 model is over $500 off and down to just under $1,200, while this 65-inch LG G2 Gallery Edition OLED TV is just over $800 off and down to $2,200. While that\\'s still expensive for a TV, the Gallery Edition sets are some of the best that LG makes. On the more affordable side of things, this 55-inch QNED80 Mini-LED smart TV is $150 off and down to just under $650.Roku Streaming Stick 4KRoku\\'s Streaming Stick 4K is on sale for $25 right now, or half off its usual price. This small dongle connects directly to your TV\\'s HDMI port and streams content in 4K, supports Dolby Vision and offers voice command capabilities via its remote. This updated model also has fast, long-range WiFi and a private-listening feature that lets you listen to your TV\\'s audio video the Roku mobile app.Fitbit Inspire 3The new Fitbit Inspire 3 is down to $70 for Black Friday, which is $30 off its usual price. We named this the best budget fitness tracker you can get right now, and that\\'s only more true when you can pick it up while on sale. The Inspire 3 is more slim than the Charge 5, and while it doesn\\'t have built-in GPS, you can use its connected GPS feature to map runs and bike rides if you have your phone with you. We also like its automatic workout tracking and long battery life.Sony DualSense controllerSony\\'s DualSense controllers for the PlayStation 5 are down to $49 in several finishes. That matches the lowest price we\\'ve seen, and depending on what color you choose, comes in either $20 or $25 below the pad\\'s usual price. In general, the DualSense is harder to hook up with a PC than its Xbox counterpart, but its D-pad isn\\'t as clicky, it doesn\\'t rely on AA batteries and its haptic feedback system is much more nuanced.Amazon Echo DotOn the top of the rest of the Amazon Black Friday deals, the latest Echo Dot has dropped to $25, and that\\'s the first real discount we\\'ve seen since the device came out a few months ago. Amazon added a bigger speaker inside this Echo Dot for improved sound, and it has a new built-in temperature sensor as well. That will come in handy if you have other smart home devices you control with Alexa because, if the temperature sensor reaches a certain level, you can program a routine to, say, start a fan to keep your environment precisely how you like it. The new Dot can also pair with an Eero WiFi system to add up to 1,000 extra square feet of coverage.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4Samsung\\'s Galaxy Z Flip 4 is on sale for $800 right now. Each iteration of Samsung\\'s foldable phones is better than the last, and the Flip 4 is no different. It has a slick design that neatly folds in half, rendering it small enough to slip into your pocket. Not only do we appreciate its attractive and more durable design, but we also like its improved battery life and the increased number of hands-free applications it supports.Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4Samsung\\'s Black Friday deals include the Galaxy Z Fold 4, which is $430 off and down to $1,370. It\\'s certainly the most polished Fold Samsung has created, and we gave it a score of 86 for its brighter main screen, upgraded main and telephoto cameras, sleeker hinge and noticeably better battery life.OnePlus 10 ProYou can pick up the OnePlus 10 Pro smartphone for only $549 right now, which is the lowest we\\'ve seen it. The standout feature of this handset is its remarkably fast charging technology: you can get a full charge in just over a half hour using 80W SUPERVOOC charging. However, US users are capped at 65W SUPERVOOC, but that\\'s still the speediest charging standard available stateside. Otherwise, we also appreciated the 10 Pro\\'s lovely 120Hz display and its fast face-unlock feature.iRobot Roomba j7iRobot\\'s Roomba j7 is on sale for $349 right now, which is the cheapest we\\'ve seen it, and you can get the j7+ for $599. This is one of iRobot\\'s latest robo-vacs and it has enhanced obstacle avoidance which lets it navigate around a robot vacuum\\'s arch nemesis: pet poop. It also has 10x the suction power of a standard Roomba, plus support for smart mapping and Alexa and Google Assistant voice control. With the j7+ model, you\\'re also getting a clean base into which the robo-vac will empty its bin after every job.Shark AV2511AE AI Robot VacuumThe latest version of Shark\\'s AI Robot Vaccum has dropped to $299 for Black Friday. This is one of our favorite robo-vacs thanks to its strong suction power, smart mapping feature and the included clean base into which it empties its bin after every job. We also appreciate that the clean base is bagless, so you don\\'t have to regularly buy proprietary bags for it.Crucial MX500 (1TB)Crucial\\'s MX500 internal drive is down to a new low of $68 for the 1TB version, and you can find discounts on the other configurations, too. We\\'ve long recommended this drive for its standard form factor, its sequential reads/write speeds of up to 560/510 MB/s and its AES 256-bit hardware encryption. It also has integrated power loss immunity, which saves all of your work even when there\\'s a power outage.Jabra Elite 3Jabra\\'s Elite 3 wireless earbuds are on sale for $50, which is the best price we\\'ve seen. Considering these buds start out at less than $100, you won\\'t find some advanced features on them like noise cancellation or wireless charging. However, they pack impressive sound quality for the price, along with a comfortable design, reliable onboard controls and good battery life.Google Nest AudioWe called Google\\'s Nest Audio smart speaker \"a steal at $100\" when we reviewed it, giving it a score of 87. And now it\\'s half that price for Black Friday. For just $50, you get a smart speaker powered by the AI of the Google Assistant, plus a speaker that delivers surprisingly good sound quality for its size and price point. We did note that the Nest Audio sounds even better as a pair, and now might be a good time to grab two.Amazon Echo Show 5Amazon\\'s Echo Show 5 is back on sale for $35 for Black Friday. This has been one of our favorite smart displays for quite some time, primarily because it acts as a great smart alarm clock. It has a 5-inch display that shows the date, time, weather conditions and more, plus it has a handy tap-to-snooze feature. And if you want it to wake you up visually, too, its sunrise alarm will slowly adjust the screen\\'s brightness to wake you up more naturally.Kindle PaperwhiteAmazon\\'s Kindle Paperwhite has been discounted to $95 for Black Friday. While we consider the Signature Edition to be the best e-reader, period, the standard Paperwhite comes in at a close second. It has a 6.8-inch display with 17 front LEDs for better illumination, plus a water-resistant design, Audible support and a battery that can last weeks on a single charge.Amazon Fire TV Stick LiteAmazon\\'s most affordable streaming stick is on sale for only $15 right now, which is half off its usual price. This is a good option if you want to upgrade an old, \"dumb\" TV in your home into a smart one. The Fire TV Stick Lite provides access to Amazon\\'s Fire TV OS, through which you can access services like Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+ and others. The TV Stick Lite supports FHD content, and you can use the included Voice Remote Lite to ask Alexa to show you the content you want to watch. If you want to upgrade a bit to Dolby Atmos, you can get the standard Fire TV Stick for only $5 more.Blink MiniAmazon has brought back the two for $30 Blink Mini deal for Black Friday. This compact, wired security camera is only meant for indoor use and you\\'ll have to keep it close to an outlet, but it shares all of the basic features with the larger Blink Indoor and Outdoor cameras. It record 1080p video and supports two-way audio, plus it\\'ll send motion alerts to your phone and you can control it via Alexa voice commands.Peloton BikeThe original Peloton Bike is $300 off and down to $1,145 for Black Friday. If you\\'re somehow unfamiliar, this is the company\\'s first exercise bike that comes with a built-in screen for taking cycling classes as well as other strength, yoga and bootcamp routines. Also, one of the company\\'s latest gadgets, the Peloton Guide, is on sale for $245, too.JBL Charge 5A little larger in both size and sound than the JBL\\'s Flip 6, the Charge 5 is usually $180 but is down to $120 for Black Friday. It has a separate tweeter, and dual bass radiators for bigger sound and of course can handle a dunk in water. It\\'s got a long 20 hours of battery life and can even share some of that juice with your devices thanks to the USB-C port.Sonos OneSonos\\' Black Friday deals include the Sonos One speaker for only $175, which is $44 off its normal price. Sonos gadgets rarely go on sale, much less direct on Sonos\\' site, so the entire sale is one to consider this Black Friday. The One earned a score of 90 from us when it first came out for its attractive design, excellent audio quality and its support for Amazon\\'s Alexa, the Google Assistant and AirPlay 2. Also included in the sale is the Sonos Arc, one of our favorite soundbars, which is $180 off and down to $719.Buy One at Sonos - $175Buy Arc at Sonos - $719Shop Sonos Black Friday dealsYour Cyber Week Shopping Guide: Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by following @EngadgetDeals on Twitter and subscribing to the Engadget Deals newsletter.

But Apple devices aren\\'t cheap. Black Friday deals have made many of the brand\\'s best and most recent products much more affordable, and many of these discounts happen to be the lowest we\\'ve seen yet. We\\'ve sifted through what\\'s out there (and it\\'s a lot) to find the best prices on the latest tech from the folks in Cupertino. Anyone looking to get or gift Apple Watches, AirPods, iPads, and more, these are the deals to go for. Here are the best Black Friday deals on Apple devices.\\xa0AirPods ProReleased just a few months ago, the AirPods Pro are the second generation of Apple\\'s premium ear buds and deliver a massively improved sound quality with excellent noice cancellation. Amazon has them for just $200, which is $50 less than we saw it for during Prime Day back in October. Our reviewer and audio expert Billy Steele gave them an 88 in a hands-on review, saying they have \"the best transparency mode you’ll find on earbuds.\"Buy AirPods Pro (2nd gen) at Amazon - $200AirPodsThe third generation of Apple\\'s AirPods are $30 off for Black Friday, bringing them down to $140. They scored an 88 in our review, earning high marks for a comfortable fit, massively improved audio and more than six hours of battery life on their own and 30 hours with the case. They don\\'t have active noise cancellation (ANC), for that feature, grab the Pros up above. If you want the previous generation of AirPods, those are going for $79 right now.Buy AirPods (3rd gen) at Amazon - $140Buy AirPods (2nd gen) at Amazon - $79Apple Pencil (2nd gen)Valentina Palladino / EngadgetThe second-generation Apple Pencil is back down to a record-low price of $89 for Black Friday. There are still a couple of iPads that only work with the first-gen stylus, but most of the higher-end models support this one. We consider it to be the best stylus for the iPad, and we like it for its low latency and built-in magnets that let it attach to the side of your tablet.Buy Apple Pencil (2nd gen) at Amazon - $89AirPods MaxReleased about two years ago, Apple\\'s AirPods Max, the company\\'s premium (and only) over-ear headphones have gone up and down in price, but this deal is a near-best at $449.\\xa0With an Engadget review of 84, AirPods Max pair up a sleek design with solid noise cancellation and on-board controls that are a joy to use. At their usual MSRP of $549, they aren\\'t cheap, which makes this Black Friday deal a very attractive buy.Buy AirPods Max at Amazon - $449Apple Watch UltraCherlynn Low / EngadgetWe gave the Apple Watch Ultra, Apple\\'s latest and most premium watch, a solid 85 in our review. If you\\'ve had your eye on the toughest wearable Apple\\'s ever made, grab it now. Amazon has it for just $739, which is 8 percent off and the lowest it\\'s been since its debut. When we took it on a hike, we had to admire its monster (yet comfortable) build and slew of outdoor-focused features, including a customizable Action button and on-board SOS siren. Of course you also get all of the health and fitness tracking Apple Watches are known for, plus a full three days of battery life on a charge.\\xa0Buy Apple Watch Ultra at Amazon - $739Apple Watch Series 8The Apple Watch Series 8 came out just one week before the Ultra, making it the latest non-top-tier Apple Watch, and it usually sells for $389. Black Friday has brought that price down to $349, which means you save $50 on a premium smartwatch that\\'s only a couple months old. In our real world test we called it \"superb watch that makes a great multipurpose wearable with excellent health and fitness tools.\" While it doesn\\'t have the hype of the new Ultra, or the budget appeal of the SE, it\\'s still the best smartwatch around.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Buy Apple Watch Series 8 at Amazon - $349Apple Watch SECherlynn Low / EngadgetIn our review back in September, we called the new Apple Watch SE \"the best smart watch $250 can buy,\" awarding it a score of 89. Now that the pre-holiday sale has dropped the price down to $229, Apple\\'s most affordable smartwatch is an even better buy. While the battery doesn\\'t have the same longevity as its Apple Watch siblings, we found it lasted until midnight even with heavy use, and never took more than an hour to refill. We liked its crisp display and snappy responsiveness and found that the health and fitness tracking were on par with the more expensive Series 8.\\xa0Buy Apple Watch SE at Amazon - $229AirTag (4 pack)Chris Velazco/EngadgetApple\\'s Bluetooth trackers come in one shape and size: small and round. But the amount of accessories made to hold them has reached dizzying heights. They make great stocking stuffers for anyone with a penchant for losing stuff and right now a four-pack of AirTags is going for $80. That\\'s the lowest price the pack has seen, making each tag $20 each, against their usual $28-per-piece price. They pair up with the Find My app on your iPhone and you can even digitally label each AirTag.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Apple AirTag 4-pack at Amazon - $80Apple TV 4K (2022)Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetApple TV 4K, the brand\\'s third generation set-top streaming device just came out in October and is down to $124 for Black Friday. It got an enthusiastic score of 94 in our review earning high marks for its zippy speeds, polished interface and glorious picture quality. If you\\'ve been thinking about upgrading your existing TV or if you want to turn any display with an HDMI port into a powerful streaming device, this is a the time to snap this up.Buy Apple TV 4K (2022) at Amazon - $1242022 iPad\\xa0\\xa0Nathan Ingraham / EngadgetApple\\'s 2022 standard-model iPad is the 10th generation of the multipurpose slate, earning an 85 in our review back in October. We were concerned at the price hike over the previous generation, which brought it to a steep $449. But now that it\\'s going for $426, it\\'s a little bit easier to add the base model iPad to your life (or someone else\\'s). What we did like was the complete redesign, the solid 10-plus hours of battery, and the addition of a landscape-oriented front-facing camera. Note that the iPad standard only works with the first generation of the Apple Pencil. For iPads that work with the second-gen pencil, go with the Pro or Air below.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Buy iPad (10th gen) at Amazon - $426iPad Pro\\xa0\\xa0Nathan Ingraham / EngadgetThe latest iPad Pro earned an 87 in our review for its fast and powerful M2 chip and having \"one of the best screens Apple has ever made.\" At the $800 list price, it\\'s steep. But right now Amazon has the premium slate for $40 off the 11-inch and $100 off most storage sizes of the 12.9-inch. Both came out in October of this year, and this is the biggest discount we\\'ve seen so far. That\\'s a good opportunity to get one of the best designed tablets on the market, complete with a nine-hour battery life and second-gen Apple Pencil support.\\xa0\\xa0Buy iPad Pro (4th gen, 11-inch) at Amazon - $759Buy iPad Pro (6th gen, 12.9-inch) at Amazon - $999iPad AirNathan Ingraham / EngadgetWhile it might be the lightest of the iPad lineup, the latest iPad Air is curiously performed just as nimbly as the Pro in our tests. It earned a 90 score, with our reviewer and Apple expert Nathan Ingraham calling it \"the best iPad for most people.\" It runs on Apple\\'s zippy M1 chip, which combined with the 5G connectivity option, effectively future-proofs the slate. We got two hours more than the promised 10-hour battery life in our tests and were impressed by the fast speed and lovely screen. For Black Friday, you can pick it up for $500 thanks to a discount and a coupon that will be applied at checkout.Buy iPad Air (5th gen) at Amazon - $500iPad MiniValentina Palladino / EngadgetIf an eight-inch iPad is more your speed, Black Friday has knocked $100 off the price of the latest iPad Mini. We gave it an 89 in our review, impressed with the complete design overhaul the latest Mini received. It\\'s got a great new Liquid Retina display with bezels that are the perfect size for carrying the (ultraportable) tablet around or using the Mini as an e-Reader. Overall, we\\'re calling this \"the best small tablet out there.\" And now the price is even smaller.\\xa0Buy iPad Mini (6th gen) at Amazon - $400MacBook Air M2Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetApple\\'s MacBook Air M2 earned an enthusiastic review score of 96 back in July. Right now it\\'s 13 percent off, bringing it down to $1,049. Our senior editor and computer expert Devindra Hardawar said this version of the MacBook Air \"set a new standard for ultraportables.\" You get the blazing fast M2 chip and an expansive and engrossing screen, all tucked into a frankly gorgeous, razor-thin computer. One of the only downsides we noted was the high price, but Black Friday is fixing that for now.\\xa0Buy MacBook Air M2 at Amazon - $1,049Buy MacBook Air M2 at B&H Photo - $1,049MacBook Air M1Devindra Hardawar/EngadgetIf you want to save even more and aren\\'t worried about having the latest model, the MacBook Air with the M1 chip is on sale for just $799. We gave it an 94 in our review, calling it a the MacBook for most people when it first hit the scene, especially those looking for a casual computer. The M1 chip will still feel like a big upgrade if you\\'re coming from an aging Intel machine, and we also liked this laptop\\'s lovely display, lack of fan noise and good battery life.Buy MacBook Air at Amazon - $79914-inch MacBook Pro\\xa0Devindra Hardawar / EngadgetApple\\'s 14-inch MacBook Pro is a whopping $500 off and down to $2,000 for Black Friday.

While we don\\'t recommend grabbing every possible smart home device in one go, Black Friday makes smartening up areas of your home a lot easier on your wallet.\\xa0Every year, the number of smart devices grows so we waded through the best deals on many of the products we\\'ve tried and recommend. Some of our favorite robot vacuums are seeing steep discounts, as is our favorite air fryer and an Echo smart display we found particularly useful. Covering just about every potential room in the home, here are the best robot vacuum and smart home Black Friday deals we could find.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0iRobot Roomba 694Valentina Palladino / EngadgetThe iRobot Roomba 694 is currently our favorite budget robot vacuum and is down to $180 for Black Friday. That\\'s 33 percent off for a $95 savings that\\'s close to an all-time low. We liked the way the 694 dependably cleaned both carpet and tile, and appreciated the excellent user interface on the app. Setup is straightforward, even for a robo vac newbie. It doesn\\'t come with extra brushes and the spot-clean function is only available as a button on the unit itself, but we still think it\\'s the best budget vac for most people.\\xa0Buy iRobot Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179Shark Ion RV765SharkThe Shark Ion RV765 is the runner up in our guide to budget robo vacs and right now it\\'s down to $150, which is a super low price for any smart vacuum, especially one with a two-hour battery life. We particularly liked the adjustable wheels that automatically reacted to the \"terrain\" of carpet, rug, or hard floor, and the intuitive app for setting schedules and otherwise controlling the robot.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Shark Ion RV765 at Walmart - $150Shark AV2511AE AI\\xa0SharkIf you want a robot vacuum that empties itself, be prepared to pay more, unless you can grab a deal like this one. Normally $600, the Shark AV2511 AE AI robot vacuum is half price right now, bringing it down to $300. As a brand, Shark keeps reaching top spots in our robot vacuum guides thanks to their intuitive app and reliability of the robots themselves. This base here will hold nearly two months of dirt and the advanced navigation technology uses LIDAR to map your home and lasers to detect and avoid obstacles. You can even set no-go zones from within the app, as opposed to using boundary tape or other methods.\\xa0Buy Shark AV2511AE at Amazon - $300iRobot Roomba j7\\xa0iRobotThe iRobot Roomba j7 is also on sale, with a 42 percent discount, bringing it down to $250. It\\'s the runner up in our latest guide to the best robot vacuums thanks to its strong cleaning power and accurate home mapping. We liked how easy the app is to use and program and the bot was great at avoiding obstacles, including any robot vac\\'s archnemesis, pet poop.Buy iRobot Roomba j7 at Amazon - $349Eufy RoboVac X8 HybridEufyWith a more than 50 percent discount, Eufy\\'s RoboVac X8 Hybrid is down to $320 off its usual $650 sticker. We gave the X8 a shout out in our robo vac guide for its great customization features, including a \"tap and go\" option that lets you direct the vac to a particular spot for extra on-demand cleaning. Surprisingly, many vacs lack that feature within their app. As a hybrid vac, the X8 can wet-wipe your floors as well as vacuum them, and comes with a fillable tank and swappable cleaning pads to enable the mopping function. If you don\\'t need your vac to mop, the vacuum-only Eufy RoboVac X8 is on sale for 40 percent off, making it just $300 instead of $500 right now.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Eufy RoboVac X8 Hybrid at Amazon - $320Meater Plus\\xa0\\xa0MeaterThe Meater Plus is the recommended thermometer in our grilling gear guide. For Black Friday, it\\'s down to $80 from its usual $100 price tag. While a wired version is certainly cheaper, we thought the price bump was worth not having to avoid the cables as you work with larger pieces of meat. It\\'s got a 165-foot Bluetooth range and the single probe has two sensors, with one end reading the internal temp of your meat and the exposed end monitoring the ambient temp of your cooking environment. Of course, as a smart home tool, the companion app controls, monitors and offers helpful guides.\\xa0Buy Meater Plus at Amazon - $80Instant Pot DuoInstant PotThe Instant Pot Duo makes an excellent gift for just about anyone, but it\\'s also a great way to add some extra capacity to your kitchen for holiday cooking. Right now, it\\'s down to $79 for Black Friday, a 21 percent discount and a great buy, considering all it can do. It features seven functions in one unit, and can act as a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker, steamer, sauté pan, yogurt maker and warmer. Customizable programs take the guesswork out of cooking common items, helping you out just like a smart appliance should.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Instant Pot Duo at Amazon - $79Instant Vortex Plus\\xa0\\xa0Instant BrandsIf you somehow don\\'t already have one or are looking to give one of this year\\'s best gifts, here\\'s a great deal on the Instant Vortex Plus air fryer. Usually $170, it\\'s down to just $100 for Black Friday. We named it our favorite overall pick when we tested out many of the air fryers on the market today. We loved the ample size, intuitive controls and how easy it was to clean. Plus, there\\'s virtually no waiting for pre-heating.\\xa0Buy Instant Vortex Plus at Amazon - $100Echo Show 8EngadgetThe Echo Show 8 earned a score of 87 when we reviewed it upon its debut and Amazon is knocking 46 percent off the standard $130 list price to make it just $70. We liked the beautiful touchscreen display and impressive sound quality for the size. It\\'s extra useful when it acts as a sort of command center for your connected smart home devices, with Alexa\\'s helpful AI guiding the way. Amazon\\'s new home screen has a better feel to it too, giving you a lot of info at a glance. The Echo Show 8 can even act as a smart cam to let you check in at home when you\\'re away.Buy Echo Show 8 at Amazon - $70Google Nest Hub\\xa0GoogleIf you\\'d rather rely on the Google Assistant for your smart display needs, the latest generation of the Google Nest Hub is half price, bringing it down to $50. The seven-inch screen is one inch smaller than the Echo Show 8, and the Google Hub doesn\\'t have an on-board camera, which some might prefer. As a smart display, it\\'ll happily act as a hub to control compatible smart home devices using just your voice.Buy Google Nest Hub at B&H Photo - $50Google Nest AudioNathan Ingraham / EngadgetWe called Google\\'s Nest Audio smart speaker \"a steal at $100\" when we reviewed it, giving it a score of 87. And now it\\'s half that price for Black Friday. For just $50, you get a smart speaker powered by the AI of the Google Assistant, plus a speaker that delivers surprisingly good sound quality for its size and price point. We did note that the Nest Audio sounds even better as a pair, and now might be a good time to grab two.\\xa0Buy Google Nest Audio at B&H Photo - $50Blink Mini cameraAmazonAdding a few smart cameras to your smart home setup lets you keep tabs on things when you\\'re gone (or even in another room) and can alert you when there\\'s unexpected movement. Blink Mini cameras are usually $35 each, but right now Amazon is selling two for less than the price of one. On the same product page, you\\'ll notice a one-camera configuration option, that\\'s $30, so this really is a case where it\\'s a better deal to get two. The Minis are motion-activated devices (as, in they aren\\'t always on)and have built-in speakers and a mic so you can hear and talk to people (or pets) remotely using your phone.Buy Blink Mini camera 2-pack at Amazon - $30Google Nest CamGoogleAgain, if you prefer talking to Google\\'s Assistant over Amazon\\'s Alexa, the Google Nest Cam battery is your best bet for indoor and outdoor monitoring. While they usually go for $180, Black Friday takes $60 off that price to make them $120 each. Unlike the wired and indoor-only Blink Minis above, these run on batteries and are rated to handle the weather outside, but they\\'re quite a bit more expensive. They send high def 1080p video to your phone or smart display when they\\'re triggered and are smart enough to tell the difference between pets, cars and people.\\xa0Buy Google Nest Cam at B&H Photo - $120Google Nest DoorbellGoogleTo keep tabs on package deliveries and other interesting goings on at your front door, a video doorbell works great. Again, if you\\'re invested in Google\\'s ecosystem, you\\'ll want Google\\'s Nest Doorbell. The Google Nest Doorbell battery runs on a rechargeable battery and is $120 for Black Friday, after a 33 percent discount. The Google Nest Doorbell wired version uses your existing doorbell wire and is on sale for $169 against its usual $180 list price.\\xa0Buy Google Nest Doorbell (battery) at Amazon - $120Ring Video DoorbellRingFor an Amazon doorbell, you have two brand options, Blink and Ring. Right now the Ring Video Doorbell is 40 percent off, making it just $60. It records 1080p video after being triggered and sends alerts and feeds to your phone or other display (like a Fire TV or Echo Show). You don\\'t have to decide when you buy whether you want to wire it in or run it on the included battery, this unit is capable of both.\\xa0Buy Ring Video Doorbell at Amazon - $60Amazon Smart PlugAmazonA smart plug means you\\'ll never have to come home to a dark room again. The Amazon Smart Plug is just $13 right now, instead of its usual $25. You can speak commands to Alexa to control whatever you plug in, like lamps, fans and holiday lights. Or you can also set up routines and schedules from within the Alexa app. It can even be used to start your coffee maker in the morning (as long as it has a mechanical switch), just remember to add your beans and water the night before.\\xa0Buy Amazon Smart Plug at Amazon - $13Philips Hue smartbulbsPhilipsSmart bulbs not only offer control using your phone, a voice assistant, or a smart display, many also come in a near-limitless number of colors. The Philips Hue smart bulb supply 16 million color options so so you can dial in whatever ambiance you\\'re in the mood for. These are usually $135 for the three-pack, but are down to $90 for the set right now. They\\'re compatible with both Alexa and the Google Assistant, and are rated to last over 20 years.\\xa0Buy Philips Hue smart bulb (3-pack) at Amazon - $90Amazon Smart ThermostatAmazonSmart thermostats can help you save energy by making sure you\\'re not overly heating or cooling an empty house. The Amazon Smart Thermostat is $18 off for Black Friday, bringing the price down to $42. You can use the Alexa app to control the thermostat, sets schedules and more, but keep in mind the thermostat itself doesn\\'t have a mic, so it can\\'t take voice commands directly.\\xa0Buy Amazon Smart Thermostat at Amazon - $42Eero Pro 6E WiFi mesh routerAmazonTo handle all of this smart home connectivity, you might be in the market for an upgraded WiFi router. The Eero Pro 6E supports WiFi 6E, which lets compatible devices access the newly opened up 6 GHz wireless band. it\\'s $120 off its usual $300 sticker price, which makes this a good time to upgrade to the latest and fastest WiFi iteration.

We put the cap at $50 and came up with over 20 deals on inexpensive gadgets along with a few peripherals and accessories you\\'ll need for this year\\'s higher-end buys. Some gadgets are going for all-time lows, like the new Echo Dot. Others, like the Google Nest Mini and the Roku Streaming Stick 4K are half off their usual price. We added a few storage cards that are seeing big price cuts too, since you can never have too many of those. For less than $50, there\\'s a lot of great tech out there, and here are the best Black Friday deals we could find.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Amazon Echo Dot\\xa0AmazonWhen Amazon\\'s Echo Dot first unveiled its new spherical shape in 2020, we tried it out and thought it was a well-rounded speaker in all senses of the word, awarding it a score of 88.

The speaker has the full power of Alexa behind it, letting you control your music, lights, thermostats and more with your voice. The Echo Dot even acts as a WiFi extender, adding up to 1,000 square feet of extra coverage, if you use the brand\\'s Eero WiFi routers.\\xa0Buy Echo Dot at Amazon - $25Google Nest MiniIf you prefer dealing with the Google Assistant over Alexa, the Google Nest Mini is a good way to go. Right now the smart speakers are just $20 each, which is nearly 60 percent off the usual $49 price tag. Like the Echo Dot, the Nest Mini is a small, round and unobtrusive device that pumps out music and podcasts on demand from a slew of apps (Apple Music, YouTube Music and Spotify among them). You can use it to control other members of your smart home domain, like your Chromecast TV or your Nest Thermostat, and it does a good job pairing up with third party smart home devices too, such as lightbulbs and alarms.\\xa0Buy Google Nest Mini at B&H Photo - $20SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSDUsually $49, Black Friday brings the price of a SanDisk 256GB Ultra microSD down to just $22, which is a steep 55 percent off and the lowest we\\'ve ever seen it.

The Fire TV interface is straightforward and is compatible with every streaming service out there.\\xa0Buy Fire TV Stick 4K at Amazon - $25Amazon Fire TV Stick MaxAmazonIf you\\'ve got a 4K screen and you\\'ve already upgraded to WiFi 6, you\\'ll likely want the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. Its down to $35 from its usual $55 price tag, which matches its price during Prime Day in October. In addition to delivering super high def images, it\\'s also designed to work with the latest WiFi network protocol. If you\\'re getting it as a gift and aren\\'t sure if your giftee has WiFi 6, it\\'ll still work with earlier versions as well.

It\\'s just $15 for Black Friday, down from its usual $30. Just keep in mind, while the bargain version of the Fire TV Stick does offer Alexa\\'s voice assistance, it can\\'t control the power or volume functions for your set. If you plan on using your TV\\'s original remote, then that limitation probably isn\\'t a concern.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Fire TV Stick Lite at Amazon - $15Blink Video DoorbellAmazonAmazon acquired the home monitoring camera company Blink back in 2017 and added its first doorbell just last year. The Blink Video Doorbell is the least expensive doorbell in Amazon\\'s lineup, and right now is down to $35 from its usual price of $50. You can use it wired to your existing doorbell wiring or run the unit on two AA batteries. Your first set of batteries is included and can last up to two years.

At just $25, it matches the price of Amazon\\'s 4K stick, and it\\'s our current favorite streaming device. With the Roku stick, voice control is handled by your choice of Siri, the Google Assistant or Alexa, and the Roku interface is straightforward with the widest selection of streaming options. We\\'re also fond of the Roku app, which allows for private listening, which means you can watch a show on the big screen, but have the audio come through your smartphone-connected headphones. The universal search function is also accurate and refreshingly impartial, not prioritizing any one streaming service when you search for shows and movies.\\xa0Buy Roku Streaming Stick 4K at Amazon - $25Amazon Echo Show 5AmazonImagine your bedside alarm clock and a smart display combined forces. That\\'s the idea behind Amazon\\'s Echo Show 5. It usually goes for $85, but right now it\\'s been cut by a substantial 59 percent to make it just $35. As the smallest of Amazon\\'s smart displays, it\\'ll fit nicely into small spaces, like small kitchens or a bedside table. And if you\\'re concerned with the potential creep factor of bringing a camera into the bedroom, there\\'s a physical camera shutter built-in. We gave the Echo Show 5 a score of 85 in our review, impressed with the quality of sound for its compact size.\\xa0Buy Echo Show 5 at Amazon - $35Blink Mini security cameraAmazonThe Blink Mini security cameras usually retail for $35 each, but the Black Friday sale brings the price of two cameras down to $30.

The Blink cameras plug in so you never have to swap the batteries, they offer night vision capabilities and two-way audio.\\xa0Buy Blink Mini at Amazon (2-pack) - $30Anker 511 power bankWill Lipman Photography for EngadgetHaving the ability to recharge a dead phone when you\\'re far from an outlet feels priceless, but Black Friday puts that price at $25 for Anker\\'s 511 Power Bank. The compact rectangular prism shape has a retractable plug and short strap to make it easy to store and retrieve from a pack. It\\'s a 5,000 milliampere hour battery, which should give most modern smartphones one extra charge. Note that it doesn\\'t come with a cable. You\\'ll need to supply one with two USB-C connectors or a USB-C-to-lightning cable, depending on the model of your phone. Also, this price on Amazon is only for Prime members, but it\\'s too great a deal not to mention.\\xa0Buy Anker 511 Power Bank at Amazon - $25Anker 511 chargerAnkerNot all chargers are created equal. Since Apple stopped shipping chargers with their phones, some people learn this when they notice their phones charging unusually slow with lower-power plug. The Anker 511 charger is a 20-watt charger that can deliver full-speed charging to a smartphone and are specifically designed to work with Apple devices. Right now it\\'s on sale for just $13. Anker\\'s tests showed late-model iPhones going from zero to 50 percent in 25 minutes. It\\'s got a USB-C port, for which you\\'ll need to supply your own charging cable.\\xa0\\xa0Buy Anker 511 Charger at Amazon - $13Logitech G435 gaming headsetLogitechLogitech\\'s G435 gaming headset typically goes for $80, but Black Friday brings it below the $50 threshold at $49.88.

Now that they\\'ve just dipped below $50, it\\'s a good day to get a pair. We called them the \"new standard for affordable wireless earbuds\" because they offer detailed and balanced sound with a booming low end. We got right around the estimated seven-hour battery life and liked Jabra\\'s comfortable new design for the Elite 3 buds.

Key among those is a new text encoder called OpenCLIP that \"greatly improves the quality of the generated images compared to earlier V1 releases,\" according to Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion. It also includes a new NSFW filter from LAION designed to remove adult content.Other features include a depth-to-image diffusion model that allows one to create transformations \"that look radically different from the original but still preserve the coherence and depth from an image,\" according to Stability AI. In other words, if you create a new version of an image, objects will still correctly appear in front of or behind other objects. Finally, a text-guided inpainting model makes it easy to switch out parts of an image, keeping a cat\\'s face while changing out its body, for example.\\xa0\\xa0Stability AIHowever, the update now makes it harder to create certain types of images like photorealistic images of celebrities, nude and pornographic output, and images that match the style of certain artists. Users have said that asking Stable Diffusion Version 2 to generate images in the style of Greg Rutkowski — an artist often copied for AI images — no longer works as it used to. \"They have nerfed the model,\" said one Reddit user.Stable Diffusion has been particularly popular for generating AI art because it\\'s open source and can be built upon, while rivals like DALL-E are closed models. For example, the YouTube VFX site Corridor Crew showed off an add-on called Dreambooth that allowed them to generate images based on their own personal photos.Stable Diffusion can copy artists like Rutkowski by training on their work, examining images and looking for patterns. Doing this is probably legal (though in a grey area), as we detailed in our explainer earlier this year. However, Stable Diffusion\\'s license agreement bans people from using the model in a way that breaks any laws.Despite that, Rutkowski and other artists have objected to the use. \"I probably won’t be able to find my work out there because [the internet] will be flooded with AI art,\" Rutkowski told MIT Technology Review. \"That’s concerning.\"\\xa0', 'content': None, 'pubDate': '2022-11-25 12:45:13', 'image_url': None, 'source_id': 'engadget', 'country': ['united states of america', 'united kingdom', 'india', 'singapore'], 'category': ['technology'], 'language': 'english'}, {'title': 'Aboitiz tops enterprise innovation in the Philippines at AIBP Conference', 'link': 'https://journal.com.ph/aboitiz-tops-enterprise-innovation-in-the-philippines-at-aibp-conference/', 'keywords': ['Business'], 'creator': ['Journal Online'], 'video_url': None, 'description': 'The Aboitiz Group’s Great Transformation to become the Philippines’ first techglomerate is driven by the world’s most powerful and sustainable fuel: innovation.

On Wednesday, November 15, the ASEAN Innovation Business Platform (AIBP) awarded Aboitiz Equity Ventures (AEV), the Aboitiz Group’s holding company, the 2022 ASEAN Enterprise Innovation Award. As a prestigious award that recognizes ASEAN enterprises that have adopted digital technologies to improve their business processes, this honor reinforces Aboitiz’s commitment to its transformative growth strategy that puts innovation front and center. Some of these technological innovations have been enabled and accelerated by Aboitiz Data Innovation (ADI), the Group’s Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) arm. Among the diverse digital initiatives across the Group, AIBP picked out Parlay, a data exchange platform powered by ADI that has unlocked the Aboitiz ecosystems. “Winning the 2022 ASEAN Enterprise Innovation Award is an absolute honor for us,” said ADI Chief Executive Officer and Aboitiz Group Chief Data and Innovation Officer Dr. David R. Hardoon. “This recognition from a distinguished organization suggests that industries are learning the value and ingenuity of data exchange platforms like Parlay in our dynamic times. It gives our team members in the region added motivation, and we deeply value the confidence that our partners and stakeholders have shown in us. On behalf of the ADI team, I’d like to thank AIBP for their recognition of our efforts and success.” Parlay inspires synergies between the Aboitiz business units. The virtual workplace of Parlay allows users to interact with diverse data sets and utilize Data Science tools and endpoints integrated directly into the platform. By securely sharing and accessing data across the business units, and leveraging DSAI to ensure an overall better service, projects spanning market price forecasting to enabling great employee experiences were explored. With the goal of becoming the Philippines’ first techglomerate, the Aboitiz Group aims to pave the way for other techglomerates and technology-enabled enterprises to foster and thrive for the betterment of the country. For the second phase of Parlay, the Aboitiz Group aims to extend it to external organizations, including other businesses, governments, and key strategic partners, so they can unleash the power of DSAI to unlock new opportunities and address business, environmental, social, and governance challenges. The plaque and certificate for the award were presented by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) Undersecretary for ICT Industry Development Jocelle Batapa-Sigue.

The government says the latest amendment to the Bill will broaden the scope of current intimate image offences — “so that more perpetrators will face prosecution and potentially time in jail”. Other abusive behaviors that will become explicitly illegal include “downblousing” (where photographs are taken down a women’s top without consent); and the installation of equipment, such as hidden cameras, to take or record images of someone without their consent. The government describes the planned changes as a comprehensive package of measure to modernize laws in this area. It’s also notable as it’s the first time it has criminalized the sharing of deepfakes. Increasingly accessible and powerful image- and video-generating AIs have led to a rise in deepfake porn generation and abuse, driving concern about harms linked to this type of AI-enabled technology. Just this week, the Verge reported that the maker of the open source AI text-to-image generator Stable Diffusion had tweaked the software to make it harder for users to generate nude and pornographic imagery — apparently responding to the risk of the generative AI tech being used to create pornographic images of child abuse material. But that’s just one example. Many more tools for generating pornographic deepfakes remain available. AI is getting better at generating porn. We might not be prepared for the consequences. From revenge porn to deepfakes While the UK passed a law against revenue porn back in 2015 victims and campaigners have been warning for years that the regime isn’t working and applying pressure for a rethink. This has led to some targeted changes over the years. For example, the government made ‘upskirting’ illegal via a change to the law that came into force back in 2019. While, in March, it said ‘cyberflashing’ would be added as an offence to the incoming online safety legislation. However it has now decided further amendments are needed to expand and clarify offences related to intimate images in order to make it easier for police and prosecutors to pursue cases and to ensure legislation keeps pace with technology. It’s acting on several Law Commission recommendations in its 2021 review of intimate image abuse. This includes repealing and replacing current legislation with new offences the government believes will low the bar for successful prosecutions, including a new base offence of sharing an intimate image without consent (so in this case there won’t be a requirement to prove intent to cause distress); along with two more serious offences based on intent to cause humiliation, alarm, or distress and for obtaining sexual gratification. The planned changes will also create two specific offences for threatening to share and installing equipment to enable images to be taken; and criminalize the non-consensual sharing of manufactured intimate images (aka deepfakes). The government says around 1 in 14 adults in England and Wales have experienced a threat to share intimate images, with more than 28,000 reports of disclosing private sexual images without consent recorded by police between April 2015 and December 2021. It also points to the rise in abusive deepfake porn — noting one example of a website that virtually strips women naked receiving 38 million hits in the first eight months of 2021. A growing number of UK lawmakers and campaign groups have been calling for a ban on the use of AI to nudify women since abusive use of the tech emerged — as this BBC report into one such site, called DeepSukebe, reported last year. Commenting on the planned changes in a statement, deputy prime minister and justice secretary, Dominic Raab, said: We must do more to protect women and girls, from people who take or manipulate intimate photos in order to hound or humiliate them. Our changes will give police and prosecutors the powers they need to bring these cowards to justice and safeguard women and girls from such vile abuse. Under the government’s plan, the new deepfake porn offences will put a legal duty on platforms and services that fall under incoming online safety legislation to remove this type of material if it’s been shared on their platforms without consent — with the risk of serious penalties, under the Online Safety Bill, if they fail to remove illegal content. Victims of revenge porn and other intimate imagery abuse have complained for years over the difficulty and disproportionate effort required on their part to track down and report images that have been shared online without their consent. Ministers argue the proposed changes to UK law will improve protections for victims in this area. Commenting in another supporting statement, DCMS secretary of state, Michelle Donelan, said: Through the Online Safety Bill, I am ensuring that tech firms will have to stop illegal content and protect children on their platforms but we will also upgrade criminal law to prevent appalling offences like cyberflashing. With these latest additions to the Bill, our laws will go even further to shield women and children, who are disproportionately affected, from this horrendous abuse once and for all. One point to note is that the Online Safety Bill remains on pause while the government works on drafting amendments related to another aspect of the legislation. Yesterday the leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, confirmed that the bill will return to parliament on Monday December 5. The government has denied delays will derail the bill’s passage through parliament — but there’s no doubt parliamentary time is tight. So it’s unclear when (or even whether) the bill will actually become UK law, given there’s only around two years left before a General Election must be called. Additionally, parliamentary time must also be found to make the necessary changes to UK law on intimate imagery abuse. The government has offered no timetable for that component as yet — saying only that it will bring forward this package of changes “as soon as parliamentary time allows”, and adding that it will announce further details “in due course”.
